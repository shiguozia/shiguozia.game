About ads.txt
The ads.txt Specification was developed in the spring of 2017. This document is the final ads.txt 
Specification Version 1.1; a peer-reviewed standard developed with the support of the 
Programmatic Supply Chain working group. This document is available at
https://iabtechlab.com/ads-txt.
The ads.txt specification focuses on protecting advertising inventory hosted by the website 
publishing the ads.txt file by allowing publishers to publicly and transparently declare who is 
authorized to sell their inventory. To meet the requirements for software applications distributed 
through mobile app stores, connected television app stores, and other distribution channels of 
that nature, refer to the companion app-ads.txt specification, also available at
https://iabtechlab.com/ads-txt.

1. ABSTRACT
As part of a broader effort to eliminate the ability to profit from counterfeit inventory in the open 
digital advertising ecosystem, provide a mechanism to enable content owners to declare who is 
authorized to sell their inventory.
2. INTRODUCTION
For brevity, we’ll assume readers are already familiar with the problem of fraud in ad tech and 
its vast scale [1][2][3]. Fraud can come in various forms, here we are concentrating on the form 
wherein ad inventory is being offered to buyers with a misrepresented label and account during 
the real-time bidding process. Typically the domain of the webpage, or the ID of the mobile app 
has been falsified to look like a site or app they do not have authorization to sell.
Here, we propose a new standard to enable content owners to explicitly declare a set of 
advertising systems and resellers who are authorized to sell their inventory. This will enable 
buyers to acquire advertising space through safe supply chains via authorized entities.

3. SPECIFICATION
This memo specifies a mechanism for publisher content distributors to publicly declare their 
authorized advertising systems and identifiers within those systems. This specification is meant 
to be used in partnership with site.domain or app.bundle within OpenRTB bid requests, or 
equivalent information in other transaction methods. It also describes the format for encoding 
the instructions to be consumed by advertising systems and their customers. Advertising 
systems should retrieve these declarations before buying or selling advertising claiming to be on 
the website.
This specification is specifically inspired by the robots.txt standard [5][6]. A key attribute is that 
the file is posted to the web serving system of the content, thus proving that the website 
authored the file. We refer the reader to various other advertising API specifications such as 
IAB Tech Lab’s OpenRTB [7] and Google’s AdX API [8] for real-time ad space sales and IAB 
Tech Lab’s OpenDirect [9] for non real-time sales.
3.1 ACCESS METHOD
Publishers should post the "/ads.txt" file on their root domain and any subdomains as needed. 
For the purposes of this document the “root domain” is defined as the “public suffix” plus one 
string in the name. Crawlers should incorporate Public Suffix list [16] to derive the root domain.
The declarations must be accessible via HTTP and/or HTTPS from the website that the 
instructions are to be applied to under a standard relative path on the server host: "/ads.txt" and 
HTTP request header containing "Content-Type: text/plain". It may be advisable to additionally 
use "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8" to signal UTF8 support. 
ads.txt v1.1
© 2022 IAB Technology Laboratory iabtechlab.com/ads.txt Page 6 of 23
It is also advisable to prefer HTTPS connections over HTTP when crawling ads.txt files. In any 
case where data is available at an HTTPS and an HTTP connection for the same URL, the data 
from HTTPS should be preferred.
For convenience we will refer to this resource as the "/ads.txt" file, though the resource need in 
fact not originate from a file-system.
If the server response indicates Success (HTTP 2xx Status Code,) the advertising system must 
read the content, parse it, and utilize the declarations.
If the server response indicates an HTTP/HTTPS redirect (301, 302, 307 status codes), the 
advertising system should follow the redirect and consume the data as authoritative for the 
source of the redirect, if and only if the redirect is within scope of the original root domain as 
defined above. Multiple redirects are valid as long as each redirect location remains within the 
original root domain. For example an HTTP to HTTPS redirect within the same root domain is 
valid. 
Only a single HTTP redirect to a destination outside the original root domain is allowed to 
facilitate one-hop delegation of authority to a third party's web server domain. If the third party 
location returns a redirect, then the advertising system should treat the response as an error. A 
future version may address other delegation of authority to a third-party web server. Any other 
redirect should be interpreted as an error and ignored.
If the server response indicates the resource is restricted (HTTP 401) the advertising system 
should seek direct contact with the site for authorization keys or clarification.
If the server response indicates the resource does not exist (HTTP Status Code 404), the 
advertising system can assume no declarations exist and that no advertising system is 
unauthorized to buy and sell ads on the website. For any other HTTP error encountered for a 
URL which the crawler previously found data, the last successfully retrieved data set should be 
utilized.
3.2 FILE FORMAT
The data is encoded as a formatted plain text object, described here. The HTTP Content-type 
should be ‘text/plain’, and all other Content-types should be treated as an error and the content 
ignored. A complete description of the syntax of this format is given in section 3.4 below.
ads.txt v1.1
© 2022 IAB Technology Laboratory iabtechlab.com/ads.txt Page 7 of 23
The format logically consists of:
● A non-empty set of records, separated by line breaks. The records consist of a set of 
lines of the form:
<FIELD #1>, <FIELD #2>, <FIELD #3>, <FIELD #4>
or
<VARIABLE>=<VALUE>
● Lines starting with # symbol are considered comments and are ignored.
● Lines containing the data format have syntax defined in section 3.4
● Lines containing the variable format have syntax defined in section 3.5
3.2.1 FILES WITHOUT AUTHORIZED ADVERTISING SYSTEM RECORDS
Some publishers may choose to not authorize any advertising system by publishing an empty 
ads.txt file, indicating that no advertising system is authorized to buy and sell ads on the 
website. So that consuming systems properly read and interpret the empty file (differentiating 
between web servers returning error pages for the /ads.txt URL), at least one properly formatted 
line must be included which adheres to the format specification described above. For files that 
do not otherwise contain authorized advertising system records, use the following "placeholder" 
record to indicate that the file adheres to the ads.txt specification:
placeholder.example.com, placeholder, DIRECT, placeholder
The domain "example.com" bears no significance: it is used here so that the line will start with a 
properly formatted, permanently reserved (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6761) alternative domain 
to a real advertising system domain.
Prior versions of the ads.txt specification indicated that publishers may simply use an empty 
ads.txt file to indicate that no advertising system is authorized to buy or sell ads on the website. 
That method is now deprecated because of ambiguities it creates and should be ignored by 
consuming systems after March 1, 2020.
ads.txt v1.1

3.3 THE DATA RECORD
The following defines the contents within each field. We refer to the IAB OpenRTB [7] and IAB 
OpenDirect [9] specs as needed.
FIELD NAME DESCRIPTION
Field #1 Domain name of the 
advertising system
(Required) The canonical domain name of the 
SSP, Exchange, Header Wrapper, etc system 
that bidders connect to. This may be the 
operational domain of the system, if that is 
different than the parent corporate domain, to 
facilitate WHOIS and reverse IP lookups to 
establish clear ownership of the delegate 
system. Ideally the SSP or Exchange publishes 
a document detailing what domain name to use.
Field #2 Publisher’s Account ID (Required) The identifier associated with the 
seller or reseller account within the advertising 
system in field #1. This must contain the same 
value used in transactions (i.e. OpenRTB bid 
requests) in the field specified by the 
SSP/exchange. Typically, in OpenRTB, this is 
publisher.id. For OpenDirect it is typically the 
publisher’s organization ID.
Field #3 Type of Account/ 
Relationship
(Required) An enumeration of the type of 
account. A value of ‘DIRECT’ indicates that the 
Publisher (content owner) directly controls the 
account indicated in field #2 on the system in 
field #1. This tends to mean a direct business 
contract between the Publisher and the 
advertising system. A value of ‘RESELLER’ 
indicates that the Publisher has authorized 
another entity to control the account indicated in 
field #2 and resell their ad space via the system 
in field #1. Other types may be added in the 
future. Note that this field should be treated as 
case insensitive when interpreting the data.
ads.txt v1.1
© 2022 IAB Technology Laboratory iabtechlab.com/ads.txt Page 9 of 23
FIELD NAME DESCRIPTION
Field #4 Certification Authority ID (Optional) An ID that uniquely identifies the 
advertising system within a certification authority 
(this ID maps to the entity listed in field #1). A 
current certification authority is the Trustworthy 
Accountability Group (aka TAG), and the TAGID
would be included here [11]. 
Declaration of certification IDs are superseded 
by the identifiers object in sellers.json.
Note: This field may be deprecated in a future 
version of ads.txt.
Note that if a parent company is operating multiple distinct SSP/Exchanges, the domain in field 
#1 should refer to the domain of the RTB connection that the bidder is receiving bid requests 
from.
Certification IDs in Field #4 are connected to the “advertising system” (e.g., SSP) and it is 
preferred to declare within the sellers.json file.
3.4 SYNTAX DEFINITION
3.4.1 COMMENTS
Comment are denoted by the character "#". Any line containing "#" should inform the data 
consumer to ignore the data after the "#" character to the end of the line.
3.4.2 THE RECORD
The core syntax is a comma separated format with three defined fields and one record per line. 
The consumer systems should ignore any sequence of whitespace or tabs. If the data is 
obviously corrupted or malformed the contents of the file should be ignored. No field should 
contain tabs, commas or whitespace, otherwise it should be escaped with URL encoding [13].
Individual records are separated by an end-of-line marker. The consumer systems should 
liberally interpret CR, CRLF etc as a record separator.
ads.txt v1.1
© 2022 IAB Technology Laboratory iabtechlab.com/ads.txt Page 10 of 23
The allowed identifiers in field #1 and by definition assumed to be valid DNS domain names 
obeying RFC 1123 [10], associated errata for RFC 1123 or subsuming RFCs.
Identifiers in field #2 can be strings or integers. For reference OpenRTB’s publisher.id [14] is a 
string field.
3.4.3 EXTENSION FIELDS
Extension fields are allowed by implementers and their consumers as long as they utilize a 
distinct final separator field ";" before adding extension data to each record.
3.5 VARIABLE DECLARATION RECORDS
Any line containing a pattern of <VARIABLE>=<VALUE> should be interpreted as a variable 
declaration and the crawler should store the data associated with the root domain.
The <VARIABLE> is a string identifier without internal whitespace. The only supported 
separator is the equals sign ‘=’. The <VALUE> is an open string that may contain arbitrary data.
The declaration line is terminated by the end-of-line marker. The consumer systems should 
liberally interpret CR, CRLF etc as a line separator.
For human readability it is recommended that variables be declared at the end of the file, but 
this is not a strict requirement and should not be assumed by crawlers.
3.5.1 SUPPORTED VARIABLES
The following variables are officially supported. Other variables may be added in the future. If 
the crawler finds multiple lines with the same variable it should read and store all of them 
associated with the root domain.
VARIABLE VALUE DESCRIPTION
CONTACT Contact information (Optional) Some human readable 
contact information for the owner of 
the file. This may be the contact of 
the advertising operations team for 
the website. This may be an email 
address, phone number, link to a 
contact form, or other suitable 
means of communication.
ads.txt v1.1
© 2022 IAB Technology Laboratory iabtechlab.com/ads.txt Page 11 of 23
VARIABLE VALUE DESCRIPTION
SUBDOMAIN Pointer to a 
subdomain file
(Optional) A machine readable 
subdomain pointer to a subdomain 
within the root domain, on which an 
ads.txt can be found. The crawler 
should fetch and consume associate 
the data to the subdomain, not the 
current domain. This referral should 
be exempt from the public suffix 
truncation process. Only root 
domains should refer crawlers to 
subdomains. Subdomains should 
not refer to other subdomains.
INVENTORYPARTNERDOMAIN A pointer to the 
domain of an entity 
that is explicitly 
authorized to 
monetize ads within 
the application's 
content. The 
partner's 
corresponding ads.txt 
file will be hosted at 
this domain.
(Recommended where relevant)
When a site or an app contains ad 
inventory that is owned by another 
partner - the app or site may list all 
domains for those partners via this 
directive rather than the original 
method of maintaining a separate 
line for every relationship under that 
partner. 
It is expected that the 
INVENTORYPARTNERDOMAIN 
reference is followed to an ads.txt 
file only (not app-ads.txt).
See the implementers notes for 
more details as this feature requires 
coordination with your advertising 
system.
ads.txt v1.1
© 2022 IAB Technology Laboratory iabtechlab.com/ads.txt Page 12 of 23
VARIABLE VALUE DESCRIPTION
OWNERDOMAIN Specifies the business 
domain of the 
business entity that 
owns the 
domain/site/app (e.g., 
example.com owns 
example1.com, 
example2.com, etc.)
(Recommended) This should be the 
same value as the sellers.domain in 
this Publisher’s entries in referenced 
sellers.json files. Like sellers.domain, 
this should be Public Suffix List+1, not 
a full hostname or a URL. For 
OpenRTB SupplyChain objects that 
are complete, the node representing 
the originating publisher (the node 
listed first in the schain object) should 
have sellers.domain that matches the
OWNERDOMAIN.
If more than one instance of this 
variable is included only the first 
should be used. 
It is recommended that this field is 
included even if the OWNERDOMAIN 
is the same as the domain on which 
the ads.txt file is found. It is also 
recommended that buyers mandate 
for sellers that are listed as BOTH in 
sellers.json to correctly list 
OWNERDOMAIN in all ads.txt files 
that they own OR represent.
ads.txt v1.1
© 2022 IAB Technology Laboratory iabtechlab.com/ads.txt Page 13 of 23
VARIABLE VALUE DESCRIPTION
MANAGERDOMAIN Specifies the 
business domain of a 
primary or exclusive 
monetization partner 
of the publishers 
inventory
(Optional, use only when relevant) 
When the owner of the site does not 
manage monetization either globally 
or in a specific country, the domain of 
the exclusive management company 
is included in this variable. Syntax of 
the domain is [PSL+1 domain, 
required], [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 
country code, optional, 
blank=global]
This variable should only be used for 
a seller who is not the publisher but is 
the primary or exclusive 
programmatic seller for this site. This 
will typically only apply if the publisher 
is not selling their own inventory in the 
given market. 
It is expected that ad opportunities 
monetized by the manager, the 
domain listed in MANAGERDOMAIN is 
also that of the node representing the 
originating publisher in a complete 
supply chain object.
There can be more than one 
MANAGERDOMAIN value but only one 
per country. A global/default 
MANAGERDOMAIN should not have a 
country “extension” on the variable 
line. The default can be overridden by 
other entries with country extensions 
included. See example for country 
declaration format.
Consult the implementation guide for 
details on use cases and potential 
SPO implications.
ads.txt v1.1
© 2022 IAB Technology Laboratory iabtechlab.com/ads.txt Page 14 of 23
3.6 EXPIRATION
Consuming systems of /ads.txt should cache the files, but if they do they must periodically verify 
the cached copy is fresh before using its contents.
Standard HTTP cache-control mechanisms can be used by both origin server and robots to 
influence the caching of the /ads.txt file. Specifically, consumers and replicators should take 
note of HTTP Expires header set by the origin server.
If no cache-control directives are present consuming systems should default to an expiry of 7 
days.
4. EXAMPLES
As defined above there are three required fields. The optional certification authority ID field is 
included in some of the examples.
4.1 SINGLE SYSTEM DIRECT
This example is a website with only one authorized system that is directly controlled/operated by 
the website owner.
http://example.com/ads.txt
greenadexchange.com, XF7342, DIRECT, 5jyxf8k54
4.2 SINGLE SYSTEM RESELLER
This example is a website with only one authorized system that is operated by a separate 
company doing resale of inventory. Their advertising system is not registered with a 
Certification Authority, so the optional fourth field is omitted.
http://example.com/ads.txt
redssp.com, 57013, RESELLER
ads.txt v1.1
© 2022 IAB Technology Laboratory iabtechlab.com/ads.txt Page 15 of 23
4.3 MULTIPLE SYSTEMS AND RESELLERS
This example is a website with multiple authorized systems and multiple resellers. Some of 
their authorized advertising systems are registered with a Certification Authority and have an ID 
issued.
http://example.com/ads.txt
# ads.txt file for example.com:
greenadexchange.com, 12345, DIRECT, d75815a79
silverssp.com, 9675, RESELLER, f496211
blueadexchange.com, XF436, DIRECT
orangeexchange.com, 45678, RESELLER
silverssp.com, ABE679, RESELLER
4.4 CONTACT RECORDS
This example is a website with multiple authorized systems and multiple contact records. 
http://example.com/ads.txt
# ads.txt file for example.com:
greenadexchange.com, 12345, DIRECT, d75815a79
blueadexchange.com, XF436, DIRECT
contact=adops@example.com
contact=http://example.com/contact-us
4.5 SUBDOMAIN REFERRAL
This example is a website that refers the crawler to a subdomain with a different set of 
authorized systems. The crawler should take the subdomain as another URL to fetch data from 
and associate to the subdomain and NOT the parent domain.
http://example.com/ads.txt
# ads.txt file for example.com:
greenadexchange.com, 12345, DIRECT, d75815a79
blueadexchange.com, XF436, DIRECT
subdomain=divisionone.example.com
ads.txt v1.1
© 2022 IAB Technology Laboratory iabtechlab.com/ads.txt Page 16 of 23
http://divisionone.example.com/ads.txt
# ads.txt file for divisionone.example.com:
silverssp.com, 5569, DIRECT, f496211
orangeexchange.com, AB345, RESELLER
4.6 INVENTORYPARTNERDOMAIN REFERRAL
This example is an app (or a website) that refers the crawler to an “inventory partner” with a 
different set of authorized systems. The crawler should take the inventorypartnerdomain as a 
domain and construct an ads.txt URL to fetch data from the partner’s ads.txt file and and 
associate it to the app (or website)’s authorized sellers list.
For more detailed implementation information and scenarios, please refer to the implementation 
guide: https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ctv-app-ads-explainer-guide.pdf
Note - Any inventorypartnerdomain entries in the second ads.txt file should NOT be processed 
(only follow one hop)
http://devsite.vMVPDB.com/app-ads.txt
# app-ads.txt file for vMVPD B:
ssp.com, vwxyz, DIRECT
inventorypartnerdomain=programmerA.com
http://programmerA.com/ads.txt
# ads.txt file for Programmer A
ssp.com, abcde, DIRECT

directive, the file changes will reflect:

vMVPDB must list every seller account on Programmer A’s ads.txt file to authorize those 
accounts to sell the inventory:
http://devsite.vMVPDB.com/app-ads.txt
# app-ads.txt file for vMVPD B:
ssp.com, vwxyz, DIRECT
ssp.com, abcde, DIRECT
ssp.com, fghij, RESELLER
ssp.com, klmno, RESELLER
ssp.com, pqrst, RESELLER
http://programmerA.com/ads.txt
# ads.txt file for Programmer A:
ssp.com, abcde, DIRECT
ssp.com, fghij, RESELLER
ssp.com, klmno, RESELLER
ssp.com, pqrst, RESELLER
AFTER
vMVPDB only needs to point to Programmer A’s domain to authorize every seller account on 
Programmer A’s ads.txt (NOT app-ads.txt) file to sell the inventory:
http://devsite.vMVPDB.com/app-ads.txt
# app-ads.txt file for vMVPD B:
ssp.com, vwxyz, DIRECT
inventorypartnerdomain=programmerA.com
4.7 OWNERDOMAIN usage
The OWNERDOMAIN variable will be used to connect the sellers.domain in a sellers.json file to 
the domain on which the ads.txt file is found. It is recommended, for clarity, that this value is 
included in every ads.txt file even if the OWNERDOMAIN does not differ from the domain on 
which the ads.txt file is hosted.
If this variable is absent, it should be assumed that the OWNERDOMAIN is the same as the 
domain being monetized and where the ads.txt file was found.

For more detailed implementation information and scenarios, please refer to the implementation 
guide: https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ads.txt-1.1-Implementation-Guide.pdf
In this example “MediaCompany.com” is the business owner of “example.com”. Therefore, the 
example.com/ads.txt file includes an entry to specify the business owner.
http://example.com/ads.txt
OWNERDOMAIN=mediacompany.com
greenadexchange.com, XF7342, DIRECT, 5jyxf8k54
4.8 MANAGERDOMAIN usage 
The MANAGERDOMAIN variable should be used to represent a publisher’s relationship with a 
primary or exclusive monetization partner. In these instances, the MANAGERDOMAIN should 
be the most direct path to purchase the publisher’s inventory.
For more detailed implementation information and scenarios, please refer to the implementation 
guide: https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ads.txt-1.1-Implementation-Guide.pdf
http://example.com/ads.txt
OWNERDOMAIN=mediacompany.com
MANAGERDOMAIN=yellowmediamanager.com, FRA
MANAGERDOMAIN=bluemediamanager.com, USA
greenadexchange.com, XF7342, DIRECT, 5jyxf8k54
4.9 FILE WITHOUT AUTHORIZED ADVERTISING SYSTEMS
This example is a website that does not publish any authorized advertising systems, reflecting 
this intent within a properly formatted ads.txt file.

5. IMPLEMENTER’S NOTES
5.1 VERSION
This is version 1.1 of the specification and every attempt will be made to make future versions 
backward compatible if possible.
5.2 GUIDANCE BY PARTY
5.2.1 SSP/EXCHANGE
SSPs and exchanges should decide which canonical domain they wish to be used in field #1. 
They should make documentation available to publishers and DSPs. Publisher-facing 
documentation should indicate how publishers can retrieve the appropriate ID for field #2. DSPfacing documentation should indicate which field in bid requests should be used by DSPs for 
checking against the ads.txt file.
It is recommended that any system creating OpenRTB bid requests place the seller’s account 
ID in the Publisher.ID field. Also ensure that the Site.Domain field is populated with the domain 
that hosts an ads.txt file where the account ID is publicly posted.
Ideally, implementing SSPs/exchanges should provide a tool to generate the exact lines for a 
publisher to place in the ads.txt file. SSPs/exchanges should also consider crawling publishers’ 
domains and notifying publishers (e.g. a warning in the publisher dashboard, e-mail, etc.) of the 
absence of an ads.txt file or the absence of appropriate declarations in the file.
5.2.2 DSP
DSPs should consult documentation provided by SSPs/exchanges as to the canonical domain 
used by the exchange (field #1) and the appropriate field in bid requests to be checked against 
ads.txt (field #2).
5.2.3 PUBLISHERS
Publishers should consult documentation provided by SSPs/exchanges as to the canonical 
domain used by the exchange (field #1) and the appropriate ID to place in field #2.
5.3 INTEROPERABILITY
Implementers should pay particular attention to the robustness in parsing of the /ads.txt file. It is 
expected that the /ads.txt files are created with automated systems or manual platform-specific 
text editors consumers of the data should be liberal in accepting files with different end-of-line 
conventions, specifically CR and LF in addition to CRLF and varying whitespace or field
separation characters.
ads.txt v1.1
© 2022 IAB Technology Laboratory iabtechlab.com/ads.txt Page 20 of 23
5.4 SECURITY
The /ads.txt declarations are retrieved and applied in separate, possibly unauthenticated HTTP 
transactions, and it is possible that one server can impersonate another or otherwise intercept a 
request for /ads.txt, and provide a consuming system with false information.
If this is a worry then the website owner should redirect unsecure http requests to https requests 
for the /ads.txt file.
5.5 SUBDOMAIN DIRECTIVES
When writing crawlers, implementers should request the /ads.txt from the root domains that are 
driving significant requests for advertising. Publishers should always post the /ads.txt file on 
their root domain. The crawler should strip the subdomains when creating the crawler’s URL 
list. The public suffix list [12][16] should be utilized in implementing subdomain stripping.
In cases where specific subdomains have different authorized advertising systems, the 
publisher should post ads.txt files only on those subdomains and declare each of those 
subdomains explicitly in the ads.txt on the root domain using the "subdomain=" variable. 
Crawlers should only crawl for ads.txt files on subdomains that are listed using the 
"subdomain=" variable in the ads.txt on the root domain.
When the ads.txt on the root domain declares a subdomain and an ads.txt exists on that 
subdomain, only advertising systems listed in the subdomain ads.txt are authorized to sell 
inventory on that subdomain. When the ads.txt on the root domain doesn't declare a subdomain 
or an ads.txt does not exist on the subdomain, only advertising systems listed in the root domain 
ads.txt are authorized to sell inventory on that subdomain.
5.6 ADS.TXT CRAWLERS
A reference implementation of an ads.txt data crawler can be found on github [15].
Crawlers that may want to crawl publisher content beyond ads.txt and read and display 
publisher content, advertisements, and connected metadata may do so if not prohibited by the 
instructions in robots.txt.
Declarations for the specification version number or the last updated date within the ads.txt file 
specifications are not specified variables. While implementers are welcome to use comments to 
include these variables, the working group does not want to make them official variables of the 
specification because there are more reliable methods for crawlers to obtain this information.
ads.txt v1.1
© 2022 IAB Technology Laboratory iabtechlab.com/ads.txt Page 21 of 23
Last Updated Date would be used by crawlers to determine how recently the ads.txt file has 
been updated. We recommend the use of two data points to make this determination. 
1. Last-Modified response HTTP header
2. Checksum of the last known file contents against the new file contents to determine if 
the file is the same
Between the two above methods, crawlers should be able to determine whether the file content 
has changed without requiring publishers to maintain another variable like lastupdateddate.
Specification Version would be used by crawlers to determine which version of the ads.txt 
specification a publisher is using. Since the creation of ads.txt in 2017, there have been no 
breaking changes to the specification. The enhancements for each version have been to include 
new variables such as CONTACT, SUBDOMAIN, INVENTORYPARTNERDOMAIN and now, 
MANAGERDOMAIN and OWNERDOMAIN. There are no decisions that a crawler would make 
based on what version of ads.txt a publisher is using. Instead, a crawler should focus on which 
variables are supported within the file and ensure that they have support for all new variables.
5.7 INVENTORYPARTNERDOMAIN DIRECTIVES
In many cases, especially in Mobile and CTV video streaming apps (aka OTT apps) it is 
common to license and curate content from other companies, and to authorize 
distribution/retransmission of the content to multiple distributor apps.
These relationships are enumerated via the INVENTORYPARTNERDOMAIN directive. Please 
see the “ads.txt for CTV explainer doc” (also available at https://iabtechlab.com/ads-txt/) for 
more details.
The crawler should fetch entries at one hop from the originating app/ads.txt (any 
inventorypartnerdomain entries in the partners’ ads.txt files should not be consumed)
This directive is only applicable if the domain is passed in the bid request using a new extension 
to the OpenRTB spec for bid level authorization:
● app.ext.inventorypartnerdomain
OR
● site.ext.inventorypartnerdomain

5.8 OWNERDOMAIN DIRECTIVE
Many publishers and app developers own and monetize multiple domains (sites) and apps. To 
make it clear who owns the domain/app. Example:
ExamplePublisher.com owns example1.com and example2.com. 
For more detailed implementation information and scenarios, please refer to the implementation 
guide: https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ads.txt-1.1-Implementation-Guide.pdf
5.9 MANAGERDOMAIN DIRECTIVE
To help clarify various relationships in the ecosystem, the spec has been updated to allow 
publishers to specify the business entity that owns a domain/app, and declare managers (e.g., 
sales houses) if they outsource monetization to another company.
For more detailed implementation information and scenarios, please refer to the implementation 
guide: https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Ads.txt-1.1-Implementation-Guide.pdf
6. SCOPE AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
6.1 SCOPE
Scope of this initial version of this standard is to define a mechanism to define authorized sellers 
for web content from the perspective of the domain owner, for the purpose of addressing some 
of the fraud scenarios related to counterfeit inventory.
6.2 OPEN ISSUES
Open issues to be considered for resolution in a future version of the spec should be brought to 
attention via contacting support@iabtechlab.com.
6.3 FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Future directions include covering allowed ad formats, syndication, and delegating authority to a 
third party.
